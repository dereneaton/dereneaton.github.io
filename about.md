Welcome to my academic website. As of January, 2014, I joined the [Donoghue Lab](http://donoghuelab.yale.edu/) at Yale University as a postdoctoral researcher. Here you can find information about my research, publications, software development, and other news. I (hope to) regularly write [_posts_](/posts/) on topics related to phylogenetics, popgen, and bioinformatics which is intended both as an online lab notebook as well as a repository for _Python_ and _R_ code. 

## Research topics:

* The influence of reproductive interference on diversification in hyperdiverse lineages
* Pollen-pistil relationships and speciation in _Pedicularis_
* RADseq phylogenetics  
* Comparative approaches to measuring introgression and its evolutionary consequences
* The maintenance of genetic variation within and across species

## Reproductive Interference       
My research is broadly focused on understanding why some clades of organisms contain more species than others, and within this context, Iâ€™m interested in the long recognized relationship among flowering plants where families with more specialized pollination mechanisms tend to contain more species. To understand this pattern I study how flower evolution affects rates of speciation, and reciprocally, how interactions among co-occurring species, especially within highly diverse clades, affect flower evolution.

## Study Systems  

### _Pedicularis_
Much of my research is focused on the hyperdiverse genus _Pedicularis_ in its center of diversity in the Hengduan Mountains of China (the eastern side of the Tibetan plateau), where nearly 300 species are endemic. _Pedicularis_ in this region frequently overlap in their geographic ranges, flower synchronously during the short alpine summer, and share bumblebee pollinators. This combination of factors raises the potential for pollen transfer _between_ different species, which can have negative fitness consequences (termed reproductive interference), and consequently impose strong selection on floral phenotypes. I combine genomic RADseq approaches above and below the species-level with field-based ecological studies to better understand the evolutionary consequences of these interactions.

### _Oaks_
Coyne and Orr described oaks as "a worst case scenario of the biological species" due to their often blurred species boundaries resulting from hybridization. Whether as a consequence of hybridization, insufficiently variable markers, or sorting of ancestral polymorphisms in large populations of long lived trees, previous phylogenetic studies have shown great difficulty in resolving oak relationships at both shallow and deep evolutionary timescales. Applying genomic RADseq data we have resolved a backbone phylogeny of the American clade oaks (Hipp et al. 2014) and shown evidence of frequent hybridization among the live oaks which affects phylogenetic inference (Eaton et al. In Prep), and which has likely persisted over millions of years (Cavender-Bares et al. In Prep).
