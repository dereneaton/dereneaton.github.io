[Full_D](Full_D.html) : Developmental variation in jucundum (PN) and lautum (Teo; subsampled first 300 branches). Each point represent the mean leaf morphology in the first leaf pair of a branch and a vector is drawn from there to the mean leaf morphology at the last leaf pair sampled in that branch.  

[Full_D](Full_D_alt.html) : The same as above but sampling the remaining populations. In some cases the developmental relationships are stronger here.  

[Full_H](Full_H.html) : Histograms showing diffrences in leaf trait distributions between species.  

[Full_S](Full_S.html) : Bivariate scatterplots showing the distribution of leaf trait values between species.  

[Pop_S](Full_S_pops.html) : The same as above but with each population highlighted.
