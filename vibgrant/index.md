[Development line plots (main pops)](Full_D.html) : Developmental variation in jucundum (PN) and lautum (Teo; subsampled first 300 branches). Each point represent the mean leaf morphology in the first leaf pair (V1) of a branch and a vector is drawn from there to the mean leaf morphology at the last leaf pair sampled in that branch.  

[Development line plots (other pops)](Full_D_alt.html) : The same as above but sampling the remaining populations. In some cases the developmental relationships are stronger here. 

[Across-individual V1 line plots (all pops)](Full_I1.html) : Here lines connect mean V1 leaf values across branches from the same individual. The lines thus show variation within individuals at developmentally homologous leaves (devologues?) and any apparent pattern of parallel lines across branches would represent the across-individual direction of variation. The third panel shows the mean V1 values of each individual, and thus the across-individual patterns.  

[Across-individual V2 line plots (all pops)](Full_I2.html) : Same as above but for V2s. Good news, the across-individual variation in V2s is the same as for V1s!


[Trait histograms](Full_H.html) : Histograms showing diffrences in leaf trait distributions between species.  

[Scatterplots](Full_S.html) : Bivariate scatterplots showing the distribution of leaf trait values between species.  

[Scatterplots x Pop](Full_S_pops.html) : The same as above but with each population highlighted.  

[Scatterplots x Leaf set](Full_S_tiers.html) : The same as above but with each leaf tier highlighted.  

[Ellipse_demo](Ellipse_demo.html) : Matrix representation demo.   

[Ellipse_demo2](Ellipse_demo2.html) : (Improved?) Matrix representation demo.  

[Ellipse_test](Ellipse_testing.html) : This is trial for what the ellipses plots will eventually look like. The points in the back will be the actual leaf values. The ellipses show evolution along the line of least resistance between two traits given constraints imposed by the other traits that are not shown. These constraints are measured in the VCV matrices __P__ and __D__.
