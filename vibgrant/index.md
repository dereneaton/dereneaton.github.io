[Full_D](Full_D.html) : Developmental variation in jucundum (PN) and lautum (Teo; subsampled first 300 branches). Each point represent the mean leaf morphology in the first leaf pair of a branch and a vector is drawn from there to the mean leaf morphology at the last leaf pair sampled in that branch.  

[Full_D](Full_D_alt.html) : The same as above but sampling the remaining populations. In some cases the developmental relationships are stronger here.  

[Full_H](Full_H.html) : Histograms showing diffrences in leaf trait distributions between species.  

[Full_S](Full_S.html) : Bivariate scatterplots showing the distribution of leaf trait values between species.  

[Pop_S](Full_S_pops.html) : The same as above but with each population highlighted.  

[Ellipse](Ellipse_testing.html) : This is trial for what the ellipses plots will eventually look like. The points in the back will be the actual leaf values. The ellipses show evolution along the line of least resistance between two traits given constraints imposed by the other traits that are not shown. These constraints are measured in the VCV matrices __P__ and __D__.
