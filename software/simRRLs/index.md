The script _simRRLs.py_ can be used to simulate RADseq-like sequence data on a fixed species 
tree topology under a coalescent model. The data are output in raw fastq format. I use this script for testing _pyRAD_. Data can be generated as if they were prepared under several lab techniques (RAD, ddRAD, pairddRAD, GBS, pairGBS), using different size selection windows, with or without indels, and with different levels of divergence between taxa.

See [__This post__](/posts/simulating-radseq-data-on-a-fixed-tree/) for example usage.
