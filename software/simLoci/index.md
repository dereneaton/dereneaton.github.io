The script _simLoci.py_ can be used to simulate sequence data on an input topology under a coalescent model with arguments to allow introgression between lineages and to modify population parameters. Several output formats are available, making it a convenient tool to test how your analysis method of choice deals with introgression.

See [__This post__](/posts/simulating-sequence-data-with-introgression/) for example usage.
