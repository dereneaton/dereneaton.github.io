### What is jekyll and why use it?
Welcome to www.dereneaton.github.io, my new static Jekyll website. [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) is a Ruby parsing engine that converts plain text into static webpages. This allows you to easily write blog posts using markdown which is a very simple way to format text, code, figures and links. Here I am using the [_Minimal Mistakes_](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) Jekyll theme. 

Perhaps the best part is that GitHub offers a free web hosting service powered by Jekyll, meaning you can host your site on github and make changes to it with version control. I considered alternative static page generators, particularly those written in Python like Pelican and Nikola, but even comparing the example pages makes clear that, at least in terms of theme development or refinement, Jekyll is miles ahead. 

### Creating this website
I followed the instructions here ([_MinimalMistakes_](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/)) to create my site, which was as easy as cloning a git repository, editing a few markdown files in a text editor, and pushing the changes to a git repository. I was then able to transfer the host name of my old WordPress site to this one following the instructions here ([link](https://help.github.com/articles/my-custom-domain-isn-t-working). 

In terms of creating download links, posting blog entries, and generally designing the site in a way I find pleasing, I find Jekyll to be extraordinarily more intuitive than WordPress. Hopefully this is useful to others interested in setting up a simple static blog/website.
