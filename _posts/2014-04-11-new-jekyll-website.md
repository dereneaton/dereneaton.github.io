### What is jekyll and why use it?
Welcome to www.dereneaton.com, my new static Jekyll website. [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) is a Ruby parsing engine for converting plain text into static webpages, meaning you can you can create web pages or blog posts using markdown, a simple language for formatting text, code, figures and links. Here I am using the [_Minimal Mistakes_](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) Jekyll theme for the overall page design. Over time I will tweak and customize it to fit my needs, and if anyone wants to you use it themselves they can simply fork the github repository in which its stored to create their own website. 

And this is perhaps the best feature of a Jekyll site, _GitHub_ offers a free web hosting service powered by Jekyll, meaning you can host your entire site on Github and make changes to it using version control. I considered alternative static page generators, particularly those written in Python like Pelican and Nikola, but even a cursory glance at the downloads or example pages makes clear that, at least in terms of theme development and refinement, Jekyll is miles ahead. 

### Creating this website
I followed the instructions here ([_MinimalMistakes_](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/)) to create my site, which was as easy as cloning a git repository, editing a few markdown files in a text editor, and pushing the changes to a git repository. I was then able to transfer the host name of my old WordPress site to this one following the instructions here ([link](https://help.github.com/articles/my-custom-domain-isn-t-working). 

In terms of creating download links, posting blog entries, and generally designing the site in a way I find pleasing, I find Jekyll to be extraordinarily more intuitive than WordPress. Hopefully this is useful to others interested in setting up a simple static blog/website.
